                                                            FACEMASK DETECTION USING OPENCV AND TENSORFLOW
                               
                               
                               
         The following project is a Computer Vision Project which determines whether a subject is wearing their Facemasks.the detectionModel or CvModel2.ipynb
         consists of training and testing of the Convolutional Neural Network which determines given a image with dimensions (224,224,3) it classifies the image
         to mask or Non mask. The model has been trained over 4200 images .
